**Registration is officially open, register now at: [http://acl.swoogo.com/naacl2024](http://acl.swoogo.com/naacl2024)**


The ACL & NAACL Exec have put together the registration fee.

# Authors Registration Fees

At least one author of each accepted paper at an ACL conference (ACL, NAACL, EACL, AACL, or EMNLP) or must register for
the conference by the **early registration deadline** and at the Author/Paper Presenter Rate. Similarly, at least one
author for any Findings paper to be presented at the event or paper at any affiliated workshop (exclusive of shared task
papers) but register for the conference no later than **2 weeks before **the conference and at the Author/Paper
Presenter Rate

## Implementation:

* Every paper will be assigned a "Registration ID"
* When participants register, they will have the choice to register as

    1. Author Paper Presenter
    2. Regular
    3. Student. 
  
* Please note all Accepted Papers accepted to the Main Conference must be attached to 1 Author Paper Present. These fees are to aid in covering the hard costs of the paper being presented at the conference. 
* When registering you will select your paper title in the dropdown box this will guarantee that your paper has been registered. (Papers not registered for the conference with the registration type Author Paper Presenter will be pulled from the conference and will not be published). Furthermore, if a paper accepted to finding is presenting, they would follow the same guidelines with the exception that Findings not presenting are not required to register for the conference. Therefore, if a Finding paper shows it’s being presented in person, and they are not registered 2 weeks before the conference then they will be removed from the program as a presenter.
* Each paper ID must be linked to an Author/Paper Presenter Registration. However, a student author on the paper registered under a student fee is permitted to present the registered paper.

## Further details:

* Invited speakers and panelists for the main conference and workshops will receive an invited speaker code according to
  policy once the codes are used, all additional invited speakers will register as an attendee. Please note Invited
  speakers do not include ACL membership"
* Workshop papers will also be included in this scheme, with the exception of shared task papers which do not require
  registration.
* Since workshop notifications can come after early registration ends, there will be a way to add a paper to a
  registration.
* Authors of Findings papers who choose to present there papers at a workshops or at the main conference will need to
  register at a Author/Paper Presenter for either the Workshop Only they are presenting at or Full Conference if
  presenting at the Main Conference. If your paper is presented at workshop but you wish to attend the full conference
  you will need to register
* D&I subsidies will continue to be available to offset registration costs and travel for those in need.
* Papers where all authors are in regions covered by the free/sliding-scale virtual registration can be registered under
  the free/sliding-scale registration fee.

# Membership Policy

The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2024) ACL member. So, in addition to
the registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50
membership fee to their registration if not already a 2024 paid member. Your ACL membership is for the entire calendar
year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL
and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying
membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on
publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls
of interest to the community.

# Cancelation Policy

Cancellation of registration one month or more prior to the conference (May 19th, 2024, or before), will be refunded
the full amount paid (Minus up to $50 processing fee).

Cancellations up to three weeks prior to the conference (May 26th, 2024) will be refunded the ACL membership (if paid as
part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200. Cancellations 2 weeks prior to start of
the conference (June 2nd, 2024), and all no-shows, will not be refunded any amount. They will be able to retain the
current full year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and have access virtually.

Exceptions: Cancellation due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness that

# Code of Ethics Policy 

"ACL adopts the ACM Code of Ethics (https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) in the version adopted June 22nd, 2018, by the
ACM Council. In its application to ACL, it is to be read in the contextually appropriate interpretation, e.g., ""ACM
member"" is to be read as ""ACL member"". Sec 4.2 should be read as follows:

""4.2 Treat violations of the Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACL. Each ACL member should encourage and
support adherence by all members of the CL/NLP community regardless of ACL membership. ACL members who recognize a
breach of the Code should consider reporting the violation to the ACL, which may result in remedial action."""

"The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the
aims and goals of the ACL. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every
person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons,
ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events
and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online
discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s
participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an
environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race,
gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging
scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of
scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the
same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.

It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly
activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the
Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence,
and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken."

# Anti-Harassment Policy

"ACL 2024 adheres to the ACL Anti-Harassment Policy. Any participant who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may
contact any current member of the ACL Professional Conduct Committee or Jennifer Rachford, who is usually available at
the registration desk of the conference. Please be assured that if you approach us, your concerns will be kept in strict
confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.

The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the
aims and goals of a ACL conference. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of
every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these
reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our events and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference. This includes speech or behavior (including in
public presentations and on-line discourse) that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s
participation or opportunity for participation in the conference. We aim for ACL conferences to be an environment where
harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to:  harassment based on race, gender, religion, age,
color, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading
verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention.
