NAACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. NAACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.

## Paper Submission Information

Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2024 October cycle using the following link:

[https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2024/October](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2024/October)

Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2024 October cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to NAACL using the following link:

[https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Conference)

Note that this link will be available only two weeks before the commitment deadline.

## Mandatory Reviewing Workload

As our pace of research continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload [here](https://aclrollingreview.org/reviewing-workload-requirement/). As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.

## Submission Topic

NAACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

* Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics
* Dialogue and Interactive Systems
* Discourse and Pragmatics
* Efficient/Low-resource Methods for NLP
* Ethics, Bias, and Fairness
* Generation
* Human-centered NLP
* Information Extraction
* Information Retrieval and Text Mining
* Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP
* Language Modeling
* Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics
* Machine Learning for NLP
* Machine Translation
* Multilinguality and Language Diversity
* Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond
* Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation
* Question Answering
* Resources and Evaluation
* Semantics: Lexical, Sentence-level, Textual Inference and Other areas
* Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining
* Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding
* Summarization
* Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing / ML
* NLP Applications
* Special Theme: NLP in a Multicultural World

## NAACL 2025 Theme Track: NLP in a Multicultural World

Current NLP tools and models, especially LLMs, require vast amounts of data to train. However, the data used often favors only a handful of over-represented languages, and even for these majoritarian languages only some of the existing geographical or cultural varieties are considered, leaving a large tail of under-represented languages, varieties, and cultures that have had considerably less attention from the NLP community. In this year's theme track we would like to focus on work providing support to the vibrant multicultural world we live in. We welcome papers in the following non-exhaustive list of topics:

* Cultural localization of language models.
* New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures.
* Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages.
* Analysis of cultural biases in language models.
* Historical considerations and diachronic analysis.

## Two Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to NAACL

NAACL 2025 will use [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the [Open Review](https://openreview.net/) platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:

* Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors;
* Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., NAACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.

NAACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with the other *ACL 2025 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference, or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.

The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.

## Important Dates for NAACL 2025

* **15 Oct 2024: Submission deadline for ARR 2024 October**
* 30 Oct 2024 - 18 Nov 2024: Reviewing period for ARR 2024 October
* 11 Nov 2024: Notification of desk rejection for submissions to ARR 2024 October that violate policy
* 22 Nov 2024 - 26 Nov 2024: Author response period for ARR 2024 October
* 27 Nov 2024 - 2 Dec 2024: Review revision period for ARR 2024 October

**Note:** All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).

**Following the [ACL and ARR policies](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/report-acl-committee-anonymity-policy), there is no anonymity period requirement.**

At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., NAACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected NAACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to NAACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than NAACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to NAACL 2025.

## Presentation at the Conference

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline of NAACL 2025 may be subject to desk rejection.

Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.
