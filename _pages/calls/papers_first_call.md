NAACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. NAACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals. 

## Submission Topics 

NAACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

* Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics 
* Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
* Discourse and Pragmatics 
* Efficient/Low-resource Methods for NLP 
* Ethics, Bias, and Fairness 
* Generation 
* Information Extraction 
* Information Retrieval and Text Mining 
* Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP 
* Language Modeling 
* Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics 
* Machine Learning for NLP 
* Machine Translation 
* Multilinguality and Language Diversity 
* Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond 
* Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation 
* Question Answering 
* Resources and Evaluation 
* Semantics: Lexical, Sentence-level, Textual Inference and Other areas Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining 
* Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding Summarization 
* Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing / ML 
* NLP Applications 
* Special Theme: NLP in a Multicultural World 

## NAACL 2025 Theme Track: NLP in a Multicultural World 

Current NLP tools and models, especially LLMs, require vast amounts of data to train. However, the data used often favors only a handful of over-represented languages, and even for these majoritarian languages only some of the existing geographical or cultural varieties are considered, leaving a large tail of under-represented languages, varieties, and cultures that have had considerably less attention from the NLP community. In this year's theme track we would like to focus on work providing support to the vibrant multicultural world we live in. We welcome papers in the following non-exhaustive list of topics: 

* Cultural localization of language models. 
* New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures. 
* Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages. - Analysis of cultural biases in language models. 
* Historical considerations and diachronic analysis. 

## ACL Rolling Review 

**ACL Rolling Review Submission Deadline:** Tuesday, 15 October 2024 

NAACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. 
Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review platform. 
Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process: 

Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., NAACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
See [https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) for more details on ARR and its two-step submission process. 

The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. 
However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.
