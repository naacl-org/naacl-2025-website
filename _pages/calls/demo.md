The system demonstration track at NAACL-HLT 2025 is a venue for papers describing system demonstrations, ranging from early prototypes to mature production-ready systems. Publicly available open-source or open-access systems are of special interest.

All accepted demos are published in a companion volume of the conference proceedings. We expect at least one of the authors to present a live demo during a demo session at NAACL 2025, with an accompanying poster.

Submissions will undergo a single-blind reviewing process. So papers may include author and affiliation information and freely make references to previously published material, and URLs.

We are incorporating ethical considerations in the review process. Authors will be allowed extra space after the main content for a broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics. Please review the ethics policy before submitting.

The papers should be submitted through the NAACL-HLT 2025 Demo track online submission system in OpenReview ([link](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Demo_Track#tab-your-consoles)). It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that they do NOT submit the same paper to both ARR and the Demo Track; otherwise, the submission will be desk-rejected by the Demo Track.


## Areas of Interest

Areas of interest include all topics related to natural language processing, such as (but not limited to) the topics listed on the main conference website. Submitted systems may be of the following types:

* Natural Language Processing systems or system components
* Application systems using language technology components
* Software tools or API for computational linguistics research
* Software for evaluating natural language processing systems
* Software supporting learning or education
* Tools for data visualization and annotation
* Open-sourced large language models and their applications
* Development tools

Please note: Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Demonstrations Program.

## Best Demo Award

We will present a Best Demo Paper Award. The winner will be chosen based on the contribution and completeness of the system, as assessed by the reviewers.


## Submission Guidelines

All submissions should be made electronically via OpenReview. Submissions must include:

* A paper describing the motivation and technical details of the system, including visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams). See examples of recently accepted demo papers in *ACL conferences.
    * The papers must be no more than six (6) pages, plus extra space for an optional ethics/broader impact statement and unlimited references. Please use the main NAACL 2025 paper-style files. Accepted papers will be given one additional page of content so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.
    * Any papers that do not follow the official style guidelines and page limits will be automatically rejected.
* A short (max. 2 minutes) video demonstrating the system. This video will be used to evaluate the paper, but won’t be published unless requested.
    * A [screencast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screencast) with audio narration is a natural choice for demos that can be presented on a screen. Otherwise, a video of a user interacting with the system can be used (see [this video](https://sounding-board.github.io/demo.html) demonstrating the sounding board system as an example).
    * The production quality of the video is not of interest. Hence, we encourage the videos to be simply a screencast of the software that is getting demoed, with zero to minimal editing efforts.
    * We recommend that you publish your video to YouTube or another website and include the link in your paper. If you prefer not to publicly upload a screencast, please submit the video (in MP4 format) as supplementary material when you submit your paper through OpenReview.

In addition, we strongly recommend all demos are provided via one of the following formats: (1) A live demo website; or (2) A website with a downloadable installation package of the demo; unless it is impossible because special hardware is required or access is otherwise limited.


## Submission Policy

The paper has to be original, written specifically for this conference and cannot be submitted elsewhere. The paper must also report on a substantial improvement (>30%), if the system that is being reported has been reported elsewhere already. Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL 2025 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other. Submissions of identical or closely related work to multiple tracks at NAACL 2025 (Research, SRW, Industry, or Demo) and ACL ARR will be rejected by all tracks.


## Reviewing Policy

Reviewing will be single-blind, so authors do not need to conceal their identity. The paper should include the authors’ names and affiliations. Self-references are also allowed. Relevant papers that meet formatting requirements will be assessed on the basis of their relevance to the demo track, contribution, clarity, completeness, and novelty.


## Ethics Policy

Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the [ACL Code of Ethics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics), and comply with the ethics guidelines for ARR submissions.

The NAACL System Demonstrations Track submission form will include an ethics checklist similar to the one used for the main conference: authors will be asked that their paper take this list into account; reviewers will be asked to ensure that papers comply with instructions from the checklist.

The NAACL ethics committee will be approached to add ethics review expertise if Senior Area Chairs request it based on issues identified by the reviewers.
